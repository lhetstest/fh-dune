                    <p>Frank Herbert (1920-1986) was an American science fiction writer best known for his 1965 novel
                        Dune and its five sequels. Born in Tacoma, Washington, Herbert developed a passion for writing
                        and storytelling from an early age.</p>

                    <p>Herbert's journey as a writer began with his first published science fiction story, "Looking for
                        Something," in 1952. However, it was his 1965 novel Dune that brought him worldwide acclaim. The
                        novel won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel and shared the Hugo Award in 1966.</p>

                    <h2>Writing Style</h2>
                    <p>Known for his complex, detailed world-building and exploration of themes such as ecology,
                        politics, religion, and human survival, Herbert's works often feature intricate plots and
                        philosophical depth. His ability to weave together multiple storylines and create rich,
                        believable universes has earned him critical acclaim and a dedicated readership.</p>

                    <h2>Awards and Recognition</h2>
                    <ul class="awards-list">

                    <h2>Personal Life</h2>
                    <p>When not writing, Herbert was deeply interested in environmentalism and ecology, which heavily
                        influenced his work. He was married twice and had three children. His son, Brian Herbert, has
                        continued his father's legacy by co-authoring additional Dune novels with Kevin J. Anderson.</p>
